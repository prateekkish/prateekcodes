Ruby 3.4 introduces the `it` parameter as a cleaner alternative to numbered parameters like `_1`. This feature addresses readability concerns while maintaining the same performance characteristics.

## Before Ruby 3.4

We had two main approaches for simple block operations:

```ruby
# Traditional explicit parameter
users.map { |user| user.email.downcase }
posts.select { |post| post.published? }

# Ruby 2.7+ numbered parameters
users.map { _1.email.downcase }
posts.select { _1.published? }
```

The numbered parameter syntax, while concise, created cognitive overhead. As one Ruby core developer noted: "I'm not clever enough to remember the order of parameters."

## Ruby 3.4: The `it` Parameter

Ruby 3.4 introduces `it` as an implicit reference to the first block parameter. 

**Important**: `it` works exclusively with single-argument blocks and cannot be mixed with numbered parameters:

```ruby
# Using the new "it" parameter
users.map { it.email.downcase }
posts.select { it.published? }
orders.reject { it.total < 100 }

# This will error - cannot mix "it" with numbered parameters
hash.each { puts "#{it}: #{_2}" }
# SyntaxError: numbered parameters are not allowed when 'it' is already used
```

The `it` parameter provides the same performance as numbered parameters while improving readability for single-argument blocks.


## Ruby Bug Tracker Discussion

The `it` parameter feature sparked significant discussion in [Ruby bug tracker issue #18980](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18980){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Key concerns centered around potential conflicts with existing code, particularly RSpec's `it` method.

The Ruby core team addressed these concerns by implementing a gradual rollout:

- **Ruby 3.3**: Warning system for potential conflicts
- **Ruby 3.4**: Full implementation with new semantics

As Matz said: "ruby 3.3 will warn and ruby 3.4 will use the new semantics." The primary motivation was reducing cognitive overhead, with one developer noting: "If you use `it`, it kinda implies there's only a single argument, so you don't need to spend time remembering whether `_2` exists or not."

Community feedback was mixed, with developers expressing various perspectives on readability and potential confusion. However, the feature was ultimately accepted due to its clarity for single-argument blocks.

## Testing Framework Compatibility

The most common concern involves conflicts with Minitest's `it` method. However, conflicts are minimal due to Ruby's precedence rules:

```ruby
# Minitest usage - works fine (has arguments)
describe "User" do
  it "creates a user" do
    # test code
  end
end

# No conflicts in practice - precedence rules prevent issues
it "processes arrays" do
  [1, 2, 3].each { puts it }  # Uses block parameter
end
```


## Key Limitations

- **Single parameter only**: Cannot be used with multiple-argument blocks
- **Cannot mix**: `it` and numbered parameters cannot be combined
- **Parsing sensitivity**: `it +1` is parsed as `it(+1)`, use `it + 1`

## Safe to Use

The `it` parameter is safe to adopt because naked `it` calls (without arguments) are rare in practice. Most existing code that uses `it` as a method name includes arguments or receivers, preventing conflicts.

Ruby 3.3's warning system helps identify potential issues before upgrading to 3.4, ensuring a smooth transition.

Ruby 3.4's `it` parameter offers us a readable, performance-equivalent alternative to numbered parameters when working with single-argument blocks.
