When I decided to audit my website's accessibility, I discovered something sobering: my site scored only 41% on accessibility compliance and had **28 critical issues**. Here's how I transformed it into a WCAG 2.2 compliant website by systematically addressing each problem.

## Why Web Accessibility Matters

Web accessibility isn't just about compliance—it's about creating inclusive experiences. Consider these statistics:

- **1 billion people** worldwide live with disabilities
- **15% of the global population** has some form of disability
- Many users navigate websites using **keyboard-only navigation**
- Screen readers help **285 million people** with visual impairments access the web

Making your website accessible benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities. Good accessibility practices improve SEO, enhance mobile usability, and create better user experiences overall.

## Getting Started: Running Your First Accessibility Audit

The first step is understanding where you stand. Several free tools can audit your website:

### Free Accessibility Scanning Tools

1. **AccessibilityChecker.org** - Comprehensive WCAG 2.2 compliance scan
2. **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)** - Visual feedback on accessibility issues
3. **axe DevTools** - Browser extension for developers
4. **Lighthouse** - Built into Chrome DevTools

I used AccessibilityChecker.org, which revealed my website had 28 failing elements across 7 categories.

## The Major Issues I Found (And How to Fix Them)

### 1. Color Contrast Problems

**The Issue**: 49 elements failed WCAG contrast requirements (4.5:1 ratio for normal text).

**Why It Matters**: Users with low vision, color blindness, or those using devices in bright sunlight need sufficient contrast to read text clearly.

**Understanding the 4.5:1 Ratio**: This means the lighter color should be 4.5 times brighter than the darker color. For example:
- **White (#ffffff)** against **medium gray (#767676)** = exactly 4.5:1
- **Black (#000000)** against **light gray (#959595)** = exactly 4.5:1
- **rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)** on white = only 2.5:1 contrast (fails)
- **rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)** on white = 10:1 contrast (passes)

**How to Check Contrast**: Use tools like:
- [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="WebAIM Contrast Checker tool (opens in new tab)"}
- Chrome DevTools (inspect element → styles → contrast ratio)
- [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="TPGi Colour Contrast Analyser download (opens in new tab)"}

**Before:**
```css
:root {
    --text-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);        /* 2.6:1 ratio - fails */
    --text-color-secondary: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); /* 2.5:1 ratio - fails */
    --link-color: #00ab6b;                   /* 3.1:1 ratio - fails */
}
```

**After:**
```css
:root {
    --text-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);        /* 10:1 ratio - passes */
    --text-color-secondary: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75); /* 5.7:1 ratio - passes */
    --link-color: #007549;                   /* 4.6:1 ratio - passes */
}
```

**Pro Tip**: For large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold), you only need 3:1 contrast. But aiming for 4.5:1 everywhere ensures consistency and better readability.

### 2. Missing Form Labels

**The Issue**: Form elements lacked proper labels for screen readers.

**Why It Matters**: Screen reader users need to understand what each form field is for. Without labels, forms become impossible to use.

**Before:**
```html
<input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required>
<input type="checkbox" id="darkModeToggle" />
```

**After:**
```html
<input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email"
       aria-label="Email address for newsletter subscription" required>
<input type="checkbox" id="darkModeToggle"
       aria-label="Toggle dark mode" />
```

### 3. External Links Without Context

**The Issue**: Links opening in new tabs didn't inform users about this behavior.

**Why It Matters**: Screen reader users and keyboard navigators need to know when a link will open a new tab, as it can be disorienting.

**Before:**
```html
<a href="https://twitter.com/prateekkish" target="_blank">
    Twitter
</a>
```

**After:**
```html
<a href="https://twitter.com/prateekkish" target="_blank"
   aria-label="Follow me on Twitter (opens in new tab)">
    Twitter
</a>
```

### 4. Missing Skip Links

**The Issue**: No way for keyboard users to skip repetitive navigation.

**Why It Matters**: Keyboard users would have to tab through every navigation item on every page to reach the main content.

**Solution:**
```html
<body>
    <!-- Skip Links for Accessibility -->
    <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
    <a href="#navbarMediumish" class="skip-link">Skip to navigation</a>

    <!-- Navigation here -->

    <div class="main-content" id="main-content">
        <!-- Main content here -->
    </div>
</body>
```

```css
.skip-link {
    position: absolute;
    top: -40px;
    left: 6px;
    background: var(--link-color);
    color: white;
    padding: 8px;
    text-decoration: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
    z-index: 1000;
}

.skip-link:focus {
    top: 6px; /* Appears when focused */
}
```

### 5. Poor Focus Indicators

**The Issue**: Interactive elements lacked visible focus states for keyboard navigation.

**Why It Matters**: Keyboard users need to see which element currently has focus to navigate effectively.

**Solution:**
```css
a:focus,
button:focus,
input:focus,
.nav-link:focus {
    outline: 2px solid var(--link-color);
    outline-offset: 2px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px rgba(0, 117, 73, 0.2);
}
```

### 6. Improper Heading Hierarchy

**The Issue**: Pages missing h1 headings, and improper heading structure.

**Why It Matters**: Screen readers use heading structure to help users navigate page content efficiently.

**Before:**
```html
<section class="recent-posts">
    <div class="section-title">
        <h2><span>All Posts</span></h2>  <!-- Should be h1 on main page -->
    </div>
</section>
```

**After:**
```html
<section class="recent-posts">
    <div class="section-title">
        <h1><span>All Posts</span></h1>  <!-- Proper h1 for main page -->
    </div>
</section>
```

### 7. Missing ARIA Roles and Labels

**The Issue**: Interactive elements and landmarks lacked proper ARIA attributes.

**Why It Matters**: ARIA attributes provide additional context for assistive technologies.

**Search Form Fix:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<form class="bd-search">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search a post..."/>
</form>

<!-- After -->
<form class="bd-search" role="search">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search a post..."
           aria-label="Search posts"/>
    <button type="submit" style="display: none;">Search</button>
</form>
```

**Navigation Fix:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<nav class="navbar">

<!-- After -->
<nav class="navbar" aria-label="Main navigation">
```

**Button Role Fix:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="slider">
    <i class="fas fa-sun"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-moon"></i>
</div>

<!-- After -->
<div class="slider" role="button">
    <i class="fas fa-sun"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-moon"></i>
</div>
```

## Testing Your Improvements

After implementing fixes, test with multiple methods:

1. **Automated tools** - Re-run accessibility scanners
2. **Keyboard navigation** - Navigate using only Tab, Enter, and arrow keys
3. **Screen reader testing** - Use NVDA (free) or VoiceOver (Mac)
4. **Color contrast tools** - Verify all text meets 4.5:1 ratio

## The Results

After implementing these fixes:

- **Accessibility score improved** from 41% to WCAG compliant
- **Critical issues reduced** from 28 to 1
- **Visual design maintained** while improving accessibility
- **Enhanced user experience** for all users

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with automated scanning** - Use free tools to identify issues
2. **Focus on critical problems first** - Form labels, color contrast, and navigation
3. **Test with real users** - Nothing beats actual user feedback
4. **Accessibility is iterative** - Regular audits catch new issues
5. **Good accessibility helps everyone** - Benefits extend beyond disabled users

## Common Accessibility Pitfalls to Avoid

- Using placeholder text as labels
- Insufficient color contrast
- Missing alt text for images
- Keyboard traps in custom components
- Unclear link purposes ("click here", "read more")
- Missing focus indicators
- Automatic media playback
- Time-limited content without controls

## Beyond Compliance: Creating Inclusive Experiences

WCAG compliance is the baseline, not the finish line. Consider:

- **User testing** with people who use assistive technologies
- **Progressive enhancement** that works without JavaScript
- **Responsive design** that adapts to zoom levels up to 200%
- **Clear, simple language** that's easy to understand
- **Consistent navigation** patterns across your site
